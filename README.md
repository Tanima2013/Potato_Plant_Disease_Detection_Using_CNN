Here I have developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for the identification of potato plant diseases('Potato_Early_blight','Potato_Late_blight','Potato_healthy'). I have utilized TensorFlow and Keras libraries to construct and train the model using a dataset of plant images. By leveraging techniques such as resizing, rescaling, and data augmentation, I have enhanced the modelâ€™s ability to recognize disease patterns in plants. Through training and evaluation, I have observed promising results, with the model demonstrating high accuracy in classifying plant diseases. This experiment highlights the potential of CNN models in automating disease identification processes, thereby aiding farmers in timely intervention and effective management practices to mitigate crop losses and ensure agricultural sustainability.
